🚗 IoT-Based Smart Parking System

A modern web-based simulation + IoT concept project demonstrating how smart parking automation works using sensors, slot detection, and real-time UI updates.

📌 Project Overview

The IoT-Based Smart Parking System is designed to automate the detection and management of parking slots using IoT principles.
It includes a full interactive web simulation, visual slot monitoring, car icon animation, and smart features such as:

Real-time parking slot monitoring

Automatic slot occupation detection

Car animation entering/exiting slots

Dashboard showing total, occupied & free slots

Clean UI simulation built with HTML, TailwindCSS & JavaScript

This project demonstrates the working model of an IoT-enabled parking system without requiring real hardware.

🎯 Features
✔ Real-Time Slot Monitoring

Each slot updates instantly when occupied or free.

✔ Car Icon Simulation

Animated car icon moves into the selected slot for a realistic parking experience.

✔ Interactive Dashboard

Total slots

Occupied slots

Available slots

✔ Fully Web-Based (No Hardware Needed)

This version is a pure web simulation, suitable for:

PBL projects

Engineering students

Demonstration & presentations
