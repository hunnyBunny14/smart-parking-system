A modern web-based simulation demonstrating how an IoT-driven smart parking automation system works using sensors, slot detection, and real-time UI updates.

📌 Project Overview

The IoT-Based Smart Parking System automates detection and management of parking slots using IoT principles.
This project contains a full interactive web simulation, including:

Real-time parking slot monitoring

Automatic slot occupation detection

Car icon animations entering/exiting slots

Smart dashboard with analytics

Clean, responsive UI using TailwindCSS

This model demonstrates how an IoT-powered parking system works without real hardware, making it perfect for PBL submissions, presentations, and academic demonstrations.
